```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`2`, `2-debian-10`, `2.32.0`, `2.32.0-debian-10-r58`, `latest` (2/debian-10/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-git/blob/2.32.0-debian-10-r58/2/debian-10/Dockerfile)

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Git Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/git).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/git:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/git/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/git:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/git:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-git.git#master:2/debian-10'
```

# Configuration

## Running commands

To run commands inside this container you can use `docker run`, for example to execute `git version` you can follow below example

```console
$ docker run --name git bitnami/git:latest git --version
```

# Notable Changes

## 2.31.0-debian-10-r2

- The `ENTRYPOINT` of the container has been modified to load a proper NSS environment that enables git ssh connections when running the container as non-root.
- The `CMD` is also changed to enter the Bash shell.

If you were using the container without replacing the entrypoint [`ENTRYPOINT [ "git" ]`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-git/blob/af46ea91cebed3de1a863cb9969210688131b4e9/2/debian-10/Dockerfile#L19), make sure you specify the `git` command now:

```diff
-docker run bitnami/git:latest --version
+docker run bitnami/git:latest git --version
```
